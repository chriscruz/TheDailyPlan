-----------------------------

The Daily Plan was found to increase patient safety during hospitalization. By importing provider orders into a health summary, patients receive an itinerary for each day in the hospital. These patient-specific reports, one or two pages in length, reflect current orders such as allergies, medications, procedures, and diet.

The Daily PlanÂ® can enhance patient safety during hospitalization/ambulatory visit by providing the patient and/or family with an understanding of what to expect during that day of their hospital stay/ambulatory visit (e.g. x-rays, medications, nutrition, etc.) and by encouraging them to ask questions if something seems to be different than what was planned.
